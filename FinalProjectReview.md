### Software Development Life Cycle
My experience began with the Planning deciding what would make a good project. My project when fully developed will be an all in one animal rescue tool. It will allow the rescue to track all of the information of the animals within there rescue as well as display them to those looking to adopt. Future developments to the design will allow for donations and volunteer requests. Designing, Building, and Testing are currently still in progress.

### Lessons Learned
I have had some struggles along the way with loosing my database having to recreate and reconnect multiple times. I was able to finally get something together with some assistance and finally get some redesigning completed. I feel lucky to just have something display and somewhat function. There is still alot of work that needs to be completed to have a deployable product.
