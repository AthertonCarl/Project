### DESCRIPTION
[Return To Top](https://github.com/AthertonCarl/YourPetPortfolio/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents)  
When I was asked to think of a web application that could improve or make something simpler.  I thought of creating an application that would make it easier for my local cat rescue to keep track of the cats on property and allow them to market them through their web page to potential adopters. This application would essentially benefit any animal rescue not just my local cat rescue.  

This web application will be a tool to help the rescue build their “library of cats”.  The library will organize and hold a variety of information available for adoption. To assist the rescue the application will have section where the information would be entered and allow for edits to be completed. The types information that will be able to be captured will be imagery and text.  Each cat at the rescue will have an image or images, name, age, sex, breed, coloring, description, and recommendation on the living conditions that would be best suited. The rescue would also be able to track medical and microchip information to provide to adopters.

The rescue would be able to all the information kept on the cats to allow potential adopters to search for their perfect pet. Potential adopters would be able to search using the following criteria color, breed, age, sex, or demeanor.  Once adopters find a cat that they are interested in, they would be able to complete an application capturing their information and the animal of interest. Their information would be provided to the rescue to complete their screening process.
